        This page is all about a self assessment of what we have done so far in
        Js, HTML and CSS. Although I have worked with these technologies before,
        it was interesting to note some of the subtleties and nuances of these
        technonlogies.

        <h2>Ice cream</h2>
        <p>
          Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or
          dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a
          sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa
          or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also
          be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen
          together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to
          stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water
          and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice
          crystals from forming.

      <h2>Ice cream's Evolution</h2>
      <p>
        Ice cream's origins are known to reach back as far as the second century
        B.C., although no specific date of origin nor inventor has been
        undisputably credited with its discovery. We know that Alexander the
        Great enjoyed snow and ice flavored with honey and nectar. Biblical
        references also show that King Solomon was fond of iced drinks during
        harvesting. During the Roman Empire, Nero Claudius Caesar (A.D. 54-86)
        frequently sent runners into the mountains for snow, which was then
        flavored with fruits and juices. Over a thousand years later, Marco Polo
        returned to Italy from the Far East with a recipe that closely resembled
        what is now called sherbet. Historians estimate that this recipe evolved
        into ice cream sometime in the 16th century. England seems to have
        discovered ice cream at the same time, or perhaps even earlier than the
        Italians. "Cream Ice," as it was called, appeared regularly at the table
        of Charles I during the 17th century. France was introduced to similar
        frozen desserts in 1553 by the Italian Catherine de Medici when she
        became the wife of Henry II of France.

      <h2>Production</h2>
      <p>
        Ice cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled
        with ice and salt. This is called the pot-freezer method.[44] French
        confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a
        sorbetière [fr] (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In
        the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by
        the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the
        ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially)
        melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing
        point of pure water.

      <h2>SEO</h2>
      <p>
        SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, it means
        the process of improving your site to increase its visibility when
        people search for products or services related to your business in
        Google, Bing, and other search engines. The better visibility your pages
        have in search results, the more likely you are to garner attention and
        attract prospective and existing customers to your business. Search
        engines such as Google and Bing use bots to crawl pages on the web,
        going from site to site, collecting information about those pages and
        putting them in an index. Think of the index like a giant library where
        a librarian can pull up a book (or a web page) to help you find exactly
        what you’re looking for at the time. Next, algorithms analyze pages in
        the index, taking into account hundreds of ranking factors or signals,
        to determine the order pages should appear in the search results for a
        given query. In our library analogy, the librarian has read every single
        book in the library and can tell you exactly which one will have the
        answers to your questions.
